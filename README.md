### Randomized Implied Volatility Parametrizations

The code is an implementation of a randomized implied volatility parametrization and is based on the article
"Volatility Parametrizations with Random Coefficients: Analytic Flexibility for Implied Volatility Surfaces".
by NF Zaugg, L Perotti and LA Grzelak

The two main run files implement two cases of randomizations of parametrizations and create plots to display the effects of the randomization. The SABR run file is plotted against real market data obtained from the Cboe Data shop.

You are free to use the codes for non-commercial purposes.
