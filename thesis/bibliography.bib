  abstract = {This paper proposes an arbitrage-free framework that enhances classical implied volatility parametrizations by introducing random coefficients. The method maintains analyticity and computational efficiency while increasing flexibility to better fit market data, especially for short-term options. Applications to real index and equity option data are provided.}
